        <p>I lived a total year lamenting that decision before I realized how stupid I was. Not for trying to kill myself, but how literally stupid I was. I lacked any ability to critically think. I couldn’t take care of myself. I didn’t even know myself.
        
        So, I taught myself how to think. I found critical thinking lectures online and listened to the entire series. I started to read physics textbooks for fun. I wanted to learn anything and everything I could about everything.
        
        Mostly though, I wanted to understand what I experienced during the NDE.</p>
