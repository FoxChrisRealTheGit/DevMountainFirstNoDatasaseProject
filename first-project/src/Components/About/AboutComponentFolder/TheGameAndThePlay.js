        <p>It took a while for me to understand the NDE. The journey to that point allowed me to understand a vast array of other things. Things like, how to understand life, how to approach life, how to learn other things.
        
        It seems simple but it took me about two weeks of pacing back and forth to think all the way through. In that time, I also came to conclusions about what it means to be human, and the current state of humanity as being post-human on the track to being trans-human; however, those conceptions are derived from the basis of the Game and The Play.
        
        I mostly understood the Game and The Play from Alan Watts lectures. My basic understanding, in simple terms, being that life is a game and society is a play. Take for example a sport like soccer. If you had the ball and were driving against a defender, you would need to be crafty in order to get by them. The same is with life. If you do the same things constantly, life will not let you pass. In the same way, society is a play. Learn your lines and to play your part and things progress smoothly. Say anything outside of your lines and people become uncomfortable.
        
        The merging of the two begins to get into conceptions of duality and unity consciousness. Further discussion into the matter brings in number theory, which I will not go into for this. IT’s enough just to mention that I came to understand the Game and the play.
        
        But just because I understood it, didn’t mean that I was good at it. In fact, I was pretty terrible at both.</p>
