        <p>I asked family for help because I needed a change in venue. My brother was gracious enough to let me stay with him. I had hope that I could just study some design things and get a job right away, but I was wrong.
        
        Turns out that the design field is very intricate and rather competitive. My time at my brotherâ€™s has allowed me to get my ACE in Illustrator. Life events stopped me from taking my InDesign and Photoshop test; however, I would like to get those soon.
        
        The time also allowed me to understand a massive amount about design. I have taught myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am fully confident that I can make websites, maintain existing web content, wireframe for UX, conduct usability testing, and design with mobile in mind.
        
        I cannot thank my brother enough for helping out when I really needed it. Being on my computer for 12 hours a day has been challenging, but I now have the skills to be able to take care of myself.</p>
