        <p>Understanding the Game and The Play came down to a simple fact that life is about skills. I realized that I needed to continuously learn new things in order to be able to win at the game on occasion. This led into me wanting to teach myself how to make my own clothes. What actually happened was that I taught myself how to make hats.
        
        Beanie hats actually. I also developed my own sort of style with them, and realized that I could make money by selling them. I developed a wide range of colors and attempted to form a business. It was my first attempt at a business and I learn a ridiculous amount.
        
        The name sounds silly, but my last name is Fox, so it was naturally to utilize that. When another person started to work with me though, I realized that the business was no longer scalable. Most people saw the business as a joke. Either way, it allowed me to learn some hard business lessons.
        
        Lessons that I had to put on hold during that time to pursue another endeavor.</p>
