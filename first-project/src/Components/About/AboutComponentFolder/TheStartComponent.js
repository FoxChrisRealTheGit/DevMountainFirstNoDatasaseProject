        <p>To anyone familiar with my poetry or stories that I have performed, it will be no shock that I attempted suicide in 2011. To others, well… I did. Lost and scared about my future, I tried to end my life. I took over one-hundred pain killers, which landed me straight into the hospital.
        
        I was told my two different doctors that I was probably not going to make it and moving me to ICU would do nothing. There was a chance that I would get moved if I started to crash, but it wouldn’t help my situation. I also had no chance to get any organ transplants. I just had to lay there and wait for the anti-venom to work.
        
        Not to sound too cliché, but laying there, I had a near death experience, NDE. I was literally not in the hospital anymore, and my life was literally flashing before my eyes. When it finished, I was given a choice. Stay wherever I was or go back.
        
        Needless to say, I chose to go back to my body.</p>
