        <p>Remember when I said that I wanted to learn about my NDE? Well… I got the chance. I put everything else in my life on hold. I attempted to mimic previous Christian monks by donating most of wat I owned to charity, and then moved in with an Archbishop to study Hesychasm.
        
        The details of my time there are unimportant and mostly for myself. I found peace there, and a want to succeed in life. It was the first time that I actually researched career paths.
        
        The experience wasn’t everything that I had hoped it would be, so I left the Kellion. But not without a great deal of mental fortitude that I did not have prior to being there.</p>
