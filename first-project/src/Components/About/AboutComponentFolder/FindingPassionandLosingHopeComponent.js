        <p>Technical writing was lame. I can do it, but its lame. Through the classes I discovered something that I actually loved. That is, design. I cared a lot more about how something looked than any other thing about it.
        
        The school that I was at did not offer any design degree path, which created a great deal of disinterest in my studies. It just wasn’t what I wanted to do with my life. Combine that with getting ruffied at a bar and you get what the end of 2016 was for me.
        
        I completely fell apart, and I wasn’t able to recover.</p>
