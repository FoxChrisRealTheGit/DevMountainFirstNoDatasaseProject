        <p>Leaving the Kellion presented new challenges to myself. One being, I didn’t really own much. Another being, what could I possibly do? Well… How about work 12-hour days near 7 days straight. Because that’s exactly what I did for a period of time. I wasn’t able to maintain it though and collapsed.
        
        I reproached the question of what to do, and got myself into school. I figured that I would study technical writing, because I love writing and it paid well.
        
        I never imagined what I would actually find though.</p>
