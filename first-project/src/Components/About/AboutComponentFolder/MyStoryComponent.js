        <p>My story starts way before I typically start to tell it; however, much of what happened prior to my starting point isnâ€™t very interesting. Unless you like hearing about a lonely gamer turned fraternity bro turned lost soul.
        
        There are plenty of hilarious stories from those times in my life, and plenty more beyond. I contest that I actually started to live and take life seriously in 2011. So, I tend to make that my starting point when I tell me story.</p>
